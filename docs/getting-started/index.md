# Getting Started

If you are completely new to service workers and sw-helpers,
the easiest place to start with `sw-cli`.

This is a command line tool that can build a service
worker that will precache the assets for your site and make it work offline.

If you'd like to make use of the functionality provided by these libraries
in your own service worker than `sw-lib` would be the best option for you.
