## Maintenance update

Workbox is a powerful library originally developed by members of Chrome's
developer relations team to facilitate the creation of Progressive Web Apps
and to improve the offline experience of web applications. It offers a suite
of tools and strategies for efficiently caching and serving web assets,
managing service workers, and handling offline scenarios. Workbox simplifies
the implementation of common caching patterns and provides developers with a
comprehensive toolkit to build robust, resilient web applications. From now
on, [Chrome's Aurora team](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/aurora) will be
the new owners of Workbox.
